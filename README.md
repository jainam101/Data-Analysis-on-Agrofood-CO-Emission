Data Analysis on Agrofood CO₂ Emission



Dataset Summary: The dataset contains emissions data from agrofood systems, categorized into:
 Emission sources (e.g., forest fires, food processing, transportation)
 Demographics (rural/urban population, gender)
 Average temperature
 Total CO₂ emissions per year and area


Conclusion from the Histogram:
 The histogram of average temperature showed a right-skewed distribution, meaning most
regions lie in the moderate temperature range, with fewer hotter regions.
 Emission levels were notably higher in areas with slightly above-average temperatures.
Conclusion from the Bar Graph:
 The bar graph comparing emission sources showed that forest fires, net forest conversion, and food
processing are the highest contributors to CO₂ emissions.
 This indicates that land-use change and industrial food activities are significant environmental impact
zones


Conclusion:
 Temperature correlates moderately with total emissions.
 Emission contributors vary significantly by area and year.
 Forest fires and net forest conversion were top contributors.
 Clustering revealed distinct regions based on emission behaviour
